### The course

The route starts and finishes on the raised banks of the river mersey with the mid section taking runners through gravel track woodlands, up and over the M60 and into stretford meadows where a travelator of a grassy lumpy mound awaits. At top of the mound athletes will double back the way the came picking up speed as they approach the river approx half a mile further east than they left it before returning back to the club house.
  The trail is almost completely flat and is approx 45% hard packed soil/stone, 45% gravel, 10% tarmac.
  In very wet weather some sections are prone to getting very muddy but seldom slippy due to the stoney nature of the track.
