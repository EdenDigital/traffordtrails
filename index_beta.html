          <h3>Info for competitors</h3>
          
          <br>All competitors must be in a fit state to undertake the 5 mile trail run as described. 
          <br>If competitors are in any doubt of their ability to complete a 5 mile run, they will be advised not to start. 
          <br>If competitors are new to running, they are advised to get a check-up from a doctor indicating  that they would like to take up running and racing as a form of exercise.
          <br>It is recommended that competitors wear appropriate trail footwear, however if the competitor feels comfortable running on trails in road specific footwear then that is their choice.
          
          <br><br><strong>We operate 4 simple rules:</strong>
          <br>1. Look after yourself
          <br>2. Look after others
          <br>3. Look after the environment
          <br>4. Try your damned hardest and
