On-line membership form

After a few outings with the club we encourage our runners to register with the Dragons and in doing so become affiliated with England Athletics.

Our annual membership fee is £20.00 of which £13 goes to England Athletics and £7 to the club.

Membership runs April to April and there will be a discounted membership for anyone joining between Jan and April.

Benefits of Membership:
The fee includes a contribution to the club affiliation to England Athletics and also your personal membership.  This membership entitles you to a discount of £2 or more on all races under UK Athletics rules (e.g. just 5 races SAVES you £10!)

As an affiliated club member discounts are available in specialist running shops (usually 10%):
Sweatshop in Hyde offer 10% discount of everything.
Up & Running in the city centre.
Running Bear in Alderly Edge.

In addition to the affiliation and discounts you also get:
Free training sessions and sports advice/coaching.
Regular emails on participation in local events.
Regular social events such as local nights out, running holiday weekends etc.

We are more than happy for potential new members to 'try before you buy', so come along to a couple of sessions and see how you get on.  When you're ready to join, just fill in the membership form and hand it to one of the committee members along with the fee.
