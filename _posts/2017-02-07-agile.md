### Back to nature

Reusing words for the purpose of business is somewhat of a pet hate of mine so lets start with a true definition of agile.

> able to move quickly and easily - Oxford Dictionary

Again, stripping away any business meaning, most of us would associate positively with the word 'agile', we would see being agile as a 'good thing'.

Whenever I hear the word agile I think 'Leopard' and I imagine one of those nature documentries where a leapord is effortlessly chasing its prey through the savana, changing direction continuously until it outmanouvers and kills its prey.

So again, forgetting all that agile manifesto bull$%^t, why on earth would any business on the plannet not want to be agile in its truest sense. being agile would be to out manouver your competitors, your market & your consumers in order to, at worst '_stay alive_' and at best to '_thrive, grow and outlive those around you_'.
