## What’s this ‘Random 5km Trail League’ thingy about?

Trafford Trails was established to raise the profile of Manchester's beautiful trails, there’s 100’s of them and most of them are completely unknown to the majority of runners.

As we can’t host our 4th Trafford Trails 5 Mile race in June this year we decided to do something a bit different, a league, a socially distanced, trail loving, point scoring league. There will be prizes, kudos, sweat and smiles.

Most importantly we will share your routes and spread the word about where the best trails are.

## What do you have to do?

During the month of June 2020:

Find a trail, run 5km on the trail, record your run, send us the result **[Results Form](https://forms.gle/qj8BkYTRqWScu5hz5)**, throw in a a selfie and tell your friends. 

If you would like to, you could also donate a few quid to charity.

**That’s it! No sign up, no fee’s. Just post your result**

OH! And you get more points the more you run. This isnt’ a one run and forget about it thing, if you want to win you will need to rack up some serious trail miles.

## The rules

* Keep your distance and be socially responsible - 2 meters!
* All runs must be recorded between 1st June and 30th June
* Your route must be 5km (give or take a few meters)
* Your route must be mainly trail, we’ll trust you not to take the p*^s but running 4km through the streets and then doing a lap of the local football pitch wont count.
* You must provide evidence of the run in the form of a link or screenshot
* You can upload as many runs as you want but there is no prize for showing off

## The point system

**Points awarded for every run**

* 5pt - for first run of the month
* 3pt - for every run there after
* 2pt - bonus for recording more than one run in one day

**One off Bonus points (not awarded for every run)**

* 1pt - run 5km under 30min
* 2pt - run 5km under 25min
* 3pt - run 5km under 21min
* 3pt - upload a trail selfie
* 1pt - run alongside a riverside or canal
* 1pt - run before 7am
* 2pt - record a total ascent over 250ft

## Prizes

* Most points - £20 Amazon Voucher
* Most runs - £15 Amazon Voucher
* Fasted 5km Men - £15 Amazon Voucher
* Fasted 5km Women - £15 Amazon Voucher
* Highest total ascent - £15 Amazon Voucher
