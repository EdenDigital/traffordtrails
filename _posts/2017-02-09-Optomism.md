### Time to get deep

This post is me laid bare, what comes next is an attempt to describe myself in the deepest possible way.

I am an eternal optimist, I stand strong in my belief that tomorrow will be better than today for absolutely every person on the planet. I am not alone but I am out numbered 10 to 1.

Every person like me that allows society to crush them, to hold them back, to tell them they can't, they shouldn't, they won't let them is a beacon of hope that ceases to shed light on a more prosperous future for us all.

For this reason, I will not be told I can't, I will not be held back and though I may be laughed at, believe me, I will be the one laughing in the end, for I am the optimist and I can hear myself laughing clear as day.


I have been held back, laughed at, kicked, mocked and believe me I have let that in

My mission is a simple one but its sum is far greater than its parts. My mission is to spread my optimism like a plague, it is to drive hope into everyone I meet, it is to say, you can, you will, I believe in you





My enemy, the people who tell me I can't, the people who laugh at my ideas, the people that say 'why'
