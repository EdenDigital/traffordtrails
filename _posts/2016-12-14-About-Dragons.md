### Welcome 1

From beginners to (a bit more) serious runners, Dragons Running club meets every Tuesday and Thursday at 6:30 pm at LA Fitness Brooklands (in the bar)

### Training 2

Tuesday sessions are 5k and Thursday sessions a bit longer, from 10k up to around 10 miles.We also meet for extra training runs and/or races most weekends.

### Socialising

It's not just about the running either, as the social section of our club organises nights out and weekends away, including running holidays abroad - probably more frequent than our races.
