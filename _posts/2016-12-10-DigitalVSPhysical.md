### Keep it honest

Ultimately it doesn’t matter whether a team use a physical or digital board to track their work, the only thing that matters is that their board truthfully and accurately reflects reality. Unless the purpose of the game is to deliberately trick the other participants then every game has one unwritten rule which is that we all play honestly.
* Goals  
* Work in progress 
* Work limits
* Status 
* Process steps  
* Progress  
* Rules / procedures  
* Assignees 
* Blockades  

All of the above are valuable on any board but only if they are accurate. I would challenge any team thinking of changing their board to first ask themselves whether or not their current board is exactly that, accurate. If it isn’t, fix it and once you have fixed it take a step back and see what it is telling you.

### My preference
Ok, it’s not like me to sit on the bench and with all that mention of honesty, here is what I really think. Physical boards kick arse almost every single time, if, and only if you are willing to put in the effort to collect data from them and keep them clean. Physical boards seem to invoke a higher level of creativity, pride and ownership. There is something about airing your dirty laundry in public that makes you want to improve your wardrobe. 
Physical boards come with little constraint, they encourage discussion and for some reason it’s usually much more obvious where your problems are when presented physically rather than digitally. One other thing I like about physical boards is that like anything physical they age and this in itself encourages you to review them once in awhile.

### A little big up for digital
That said, digital boards have their advantages to, mainly that they come equipped with a load of nicely prepared charts, graphs, filters and reports. They are also quick to spin up and even quicker to change. Most importantly digital boards are available from anywhere, something that for distributed teams is nothing less than essential.

### To conclude
All teams need and should have a physical space to call their own, to jot down their ideas, stick up their achievements,  pictures of their pets and remind them of their goals. This for me is not up for debate, whether or not a team use a physical or digital board to track their work is really up to them but like anything it’s always worth having a try before making a final judgement.
