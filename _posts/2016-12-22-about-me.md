### Who am I?

### My career

**BBC TV Applications**  
For the last few years (2014-2016) I have been working at the BBC as a Project Manager - in essence I have been attempting to provide leadership to the teams that that put some pretty cool app's on your TV's.  

**Health Care IT**  
Before that I spent almost 10 years (2004-2014) saving your life working on systems for the public and private health care industry.  

**A drunken but studious youth**  
and even further back, long before I could grow stubble I dabbled at making software, getting a degree in e-business and being a drunk. At one point I even tried to take on HMV by developing the UK's first online only record retailer...that didn't quite work out as desired.
