FAQs
It is very seldom that we get someone who just turns up for the first time without having asked us a few questions via email before their first run, as a result we have collated some of the more frequently asked questions and provided some answers.......



### The BIG question..........RUNNING PACE!

This question comes in a variety of ways, 

"Will I be too slow?"

"I haven’t run for a long time, will I be good enough?"

"What sort of pace do people run at?"

Answer: No one is too slow (or too fast), on a Tuesday night we have runners finishing the 5km route anywhere between 20 minutes and 40 minutes and our back runner (a.k.a., responsible adult) will always keep the slower runners company at the back and offer general good banter and kind words of encouragement. 

### The key thing here is that you can finish a 5km run, so all we would ask if you are brand new to running is that you bring yourself up to a level of fitness whereby you can complete a 5km run before coming out on a club run. NHS Schemes such as ‘Couch to 5km’ are absolutely fantastic to give you that basic level of fitness.

### At what point do I need to become a Club member?

We recommend you come out on a couple of Club runs before becoming a member, this makes sure that you feel comfortable running with the Club and buy into the Club ethos before committing any money. 

Once you have run three times with the Club, we would ask that you complete a membership form and pay your annual subs of £15.

Please do not enter any races as a member of 'Dragons Running Club' until you have received your registration number.

See our 'Membership' page for more information.

### What does it mean to be a member?

Ultimately in means you can race in affiliation with the club which will result in a discounted race entry fee. It also gives you the right to adorn our awesome race kit which we are sure would win global awards for ‘best club kit’ if any such awards existed.

The club is a ‘not for profit’ organisation, so all money will ultimately be fed back into the club via club organised events, specialised training etc

### When do you run?

See our training page http://www.dragonsrunningsale.co.uk/training

### Can Children (u18’s) become members and/or run with the club

All under 18’s should be accompanied by a parent/guardian when running with the club. Not all of our run leaders have DBS checks which means we cannot legally take responsibility for an under 18 when out on a club run.
