### Down with the system
Any manager I have ever worked for will confirm my utter dislike of reporting, they will tell you of my 
relentless fight against the system and probably how they wished that I would just do what I was told.    

The truth is that I can’t, I can’t do what I am told if I do not know why I am doing it. The problem with 
most reporting is that it is done ‘just because’, just because someone a long time ago in a far off galaxy 
asked for something on a whim and zombie like project managers have for evermore been reporting on that whim.

### Always start with why
Any good rebellion needs a cause and the rebellion against reports should simply be an unselfish quest for value. I specifically 
say ‘unselfish’ because it’s easy to say ‘what’s in it for me?’ and though the answer maybe ‘nothing’, 
that doesn’t mean that your report is not valuable in the wider context of the business.    

If you start a new role and have to write a report, don’t simply do it, be brave, challenge the status quo and ask ‘why?’. 
Focus on the outcome not the output, i.e, focus on influencing action taking and decision making. If your report will not 
influence either action or decision then it is in essence useless.

### Real-time and automated
A crew I worked with made a pledge in their manifesto that went “Once, Twice, Automate Thrice”. In practice this turned out 
to be an incredibly difficult pledge to live up to but it summarises my view on creating reports brilliantly. 
Reports can drain you of your time and what’s worse is that you tend to write them weekly. If you added up all that lost 
time that could be spent actually talking to people it would be a lot of time indeed. So, once you have figured out what 
is actually valuable to report, do whatever it takes to reduce the effort to do so.    

Also, don’t limit your medium, a verbal 
report can be just as valuable as a written one so don’t rule out just delivering your message vocally.

### Resistance is futile
As the zombie like Borg say, ‘resistance is futile’, it wasn’t, Picard kicked their arse eventually but 
that simple phrase made the Borg one of the most terrifying trecky villains of all time. Rightly so, fighting 
a lost battle is soul destroying.    

If you are one of 100 PM’s writing a standard report, resistance would be futile, so like Picard don’t fight them, 
join them. Work with them, go with the flow, find a weakness and expose it gradually by planting seeds and gaining 
wider support from your close peers and stakeholders before taking on the system as a whole.
