### Selfish deeds 
We are all selfish to some extent or another, in fact I reckon you could put us all on a scale somewhere between the sacrificial
lambs and the complete and utter arseholes.  

The lambs being those people that just do and agree with what everyone else wants regardless of their opinions or how they 
might be affected. In a time of conflict these folk will usually abstain from putting any opinion forward or just hide out 
of sight completely.  

The arseholes at the other end of the scale are unable to see beyond their own needs and wants. Worst case, they will ignore 
all fact and evidence and stand unmovable from their cause.  

To be clear, the lambs are just as selfish as the arseholes, just in a very different way.

### Acceptance
This post however is about conflict not selfishness, or is it?  

If everyone was capable of having completely unselfish debate based purely on fact, evidence and reason then conflict
would (in my opinion) not arise.  

So, actually the key to accepting and dealing with conflict is first to accept that we are all a little bit selfish and as I mention in my post about teams we are all driven by a large number of conflicting motivational forces. 

### Time to bare all
If we can start more discussions by asking each individual what a pleasing outcome would be to them (and why) then we
can start to debate solutions that are beneficial to all. At the very least we can begin to understand why some people may be dissatisfied with the way the discussion is going.  

In software you often here engineers saying ‘provide us with a problem or opportunity and let us explore the possible solutions’. 
The same applies to pretty much every aspect of life, if you can step back from suggesting solutions and instead express your 
problems and/or opportunities then you will find everyone much more willing to help and conflict will naturally dissipate. 

### Be the better person
So, here’s a challenge. Next time you feel you are veering into a confrontation take a pause and ask yourself 
- what do you actually want for yourself?
- Then ask yourself ‘why?’
- Then ask yourself - ‘Does that really matter?’
- If the answer is ‘yes it matters’ then let the other person/people know and ask them what matters to them. Maybe even get everyone to stick their desires/motives up on a wall.  

If the process of doing this didn’t resolve the conflict then restart the conversations, this time with context and understanding rather than with ignorance and selfishness.
