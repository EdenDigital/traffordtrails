We try to keep our runs varied and will mix it up week on week with a different but well trodden route from a list of favorites which usually follow circular routes looping towards places like Ashton on Mersey, Timperly & Altrincham.

From April to September our runs will also take us on more scenic routes down the canals and around Chorlton and Sale water parks. 

## Beginner Friendly

Each week one of our regular runners will volunteer as 'responsible adult' and will make sure everyone is happy and knows where they are going before setting off. The responsible adult will also take a count of runners and run at the back of the pack to make sure no one gets lost. Please remember to say 'thank you'.

## Special 'All ability' Hill and Speed Training Events - Last Thursday of the Month
(always check facebook for details as the dates and locations may vary)

A real emphasis on 'all ability' - these sessions are meant for everyone!  You do not need to be able to run continuously for more than 1 mile; you can run as fast or as slow as you want and there is no pressure.  In addition to giving your heart a great workout, being pushed to a different level and then recovering, there is also plenty of chance for chats - in between catching your breath...
