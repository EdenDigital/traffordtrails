### Back to nature

I have said it in a few other posts, I hate 'business terms' so here are some non-business ones.

> Lean - having no superfluous fat - Oxford Dictionary
> Superfluous - more than is needed - Oxford Dictionary

Lean is a quirkly old term and has dipped in and out of favour due to its association with 'downsizing' and 'redundancies'. In certain industries the mear mention of the word can invoke immediate union action.

That said, in software we kind of like it and it can be used in lots of ways. 

lean processes - limiting wip, removing handoff's, swarming, pairing
lean code - reuseable code, hectagonal architectures, yagni
lean products - worse is better, mvp, concierge, enough's enough

I like to think of lean simply as 'only doing what is needed' - no more, no less.

The complexity with this simple statement is the word 'needed' and how we determine exactly what the right amount is.

### Need vs. Want
