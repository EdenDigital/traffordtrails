### Back to nature

I have said it in a few other posts, I hate 'business terms' so here are some non-business ones.

> Lean - having no superfluous fat - Oxford Dictionary
> Superfluous - more than is needed - Oxford Dictionary

Lean is a quirkly old term and has dipped in and out of favour due to its association with 'downsizing' and 'redundancies'. In certain industries the mear mention of the word can invoke immediate union action.

That said, in software we kind of like it and it can be used in lots of ways. 

lean processes - limiting wip, removing handoff's, swarming, pairing
lean code - reuseable code, hectagonal architectures, yagni
lean products - worse is better, mvp, concierge, enough's enough

I like to think of lean simply as 'only doing what is needed' - no more, no less.

The complexity with this simple statement is the word 'needed' and how we determine exactly what the right amount is.

### Need vs. Want

So I want a six pack, but, i'm an endurance runner so I actually need a bit of fat on me in order to feed my body on long runs. My need outweighs my want.

My experience of software development is that we spend a great amount of time focussing on what people want and not enough time focussing on what people need.

I often think actually that waterfall wasn't that bad, the problem wasn't really the process it was the people who used it. Give people a 'requirement phase' and they will think of everything, extend that into a design phase and we will think of a few more things. 

If you have an hour to walk around a shop, god knows how much you will buy, give you 60 seconds and I gauruntee you will only leave with what you really really need.
