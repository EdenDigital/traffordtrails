### Bunjiiiiiiiiiiiii
Imagine you are standing in the queue for a bunji jump, you are nervous and a little excited but you are not worried. 
You have made a decision that hurling yourself off a 200ft bridge attached to nothing but a piece of rope is a perfectly 
acceptable risk to take.  

For sure, there is an element of risk, for sure there is a chance you might kill yourself but you have decided that this 
particular bunji experience is ‘reliable’. You have seen person after person jump ahead of you and you know the rope has 
been here for years. No one has died yet, I repeat, this is a ‘reliable’ bunji.

### Trust me, I've done this before!
To be reliable someone or something must have a track record in achieving a certain standard. In people terms it could 
be getting to work on time, always delivering within the boundaries of a work estimate or never introducing bugs. 
In technology terms it could be related to up time, error rates or transaction speed. We may also assess a team in terms 
of delivery cadence, keeping their WIP low or their ability to share their learnings.  

No matter whether man or machine what reliability gives you ‘the stakeholder’ is an increased level of trust over something or 
someone that is not reliable. 

### Risky business
Great, you trust me, him, that server over there, so what?!?  

Well for a start, you are probably going to save some money because when you trust something you wrap less control around it, 
you are willing to take more risk. E.g., a new business with three new teams might hire a manager to look after each team. As of yet 
those teams don’t have a track record, they are not yet reliable.  

As teams mature and become reliable the need for a dedicated manager will become less. Eventually you may only need one manager 
rather than three, a 66% cost saving.

### No.45 with chips & a portion of fish
So, what’s the takeaway? Well, there are two. Firstly, trust is not given, it’s earned. Don’t expect anyone to trust you until 
you have created your very own track record, until you, yourself are reliable.  

Secondly, control’s whether around people or technology are expensive and often become less needed with time. Make sure you 
constantly re-assess the track record and thus reliability of the people you work with and rely on and the technology you use.
If you earn how to identify the reliable you will learn to trust and find yourself able to take the risks required to grow.
