BENEFITS OF A RUNNING GROUP
Below are five benefits to running with a group. I’d love to hear your thoughts, so leave them in the comments below.
 #1. Accountability

Running groups hold you accountable when that little voice in your head tries to convince you to skip the run. When there are others counting on you, you’re more likely to show up. One of the biggest reasons people stop running is because they lack this accountability.
#2. Consistency

One of best ways to become a better runner is to do it more. Having a regular, weekly (daily in some cases) running group will help ensure that you stick with your running not only during race season, but in the middle of winter when it’s even harder to get those miles in.
#3. Motivation through Running with a Group

From my experience, running with a group is incredibly motivating because there is ALWAYS someone who is faster than me. This motivates and encourages me to work hard. When you run with a group, everyone there knows what each other is going through, and that commiseration can motivate you all the way through your next race.

#4. Learn from Others

Running with a group is also a great way to learn tips and tricks about becoming a better runner. Some running groups offer formal coaching or classes. Others simply offer a time, location and other people. In all settings, it’s virtually impossible NOT to learn from the collective wisdom of the group. Stick with it long enough, and all of that running experience will rub off. Runners tend to talk about running while running.
#5. Social Facilitation

There is actually some psychological benefits to running with a group. Social Facilitation is a social psychology term that means “an improvement in performance produced by the mere presence of others.” According to Cindra Kamphoff, Ph.D, when running with a group, “You get caught up in the pace, and you might not recognize how fast you’re going” she says. Your brain encourages you to keep up when you might have slowed down alone. I have found this to be true more time than I can count.
Running with other people creates an excitement that helps you run faster than you thought you could on your own.

#6. Safety
It's obviously much safer to run in pairs or with a group. It's tough to get lost if you're with a group and, even if you do take a wrong turn, you have each other to figure out how to find your way. When running with a group, you're less likely to need to listen to music, which means you won't be distracted or not able to hear cars or other hazards. And if someone in the group gets injured or sick, there's always someone there to help. Potential attackers are also more likely to strike a lone runner than they are a group.

#6. Creative stimulation
Some people prefer to run alone so they can sort out their thoughts and do some brainstorming. But running in a group may actually get your creative juices flowing even more than running solo because you're able to bounce ideas off other people and ask them for feedback on a project or problem you're working out.

#7. Bust Bordem
Although I do sometimes like my alone time when running on my own, my group runs fly by much faster. It's tough to get bored when you're running with others. You're also more likely to explore new running routes when running with a group, which will definitely make your runs more interesting.

#8. Sense of Community
Running with a group gives you an incredible sense of community. Whether you're racing together, volunteering at a race, or cheering on your teammates, it's fun and rewarding to be connected with like-minded people and be part of something that's bigger than you. Runners can really relate to each other and are supportive of one another through running (non-running) problems and triumphs.

#9. Social Circle, maybe even romance
Anyone who has run with a group knows that it's a great opportunity to get to know people with similar interests. Many people have met their spouse, significant other, or close friends through a running group or club.  Some runners end up traveling to destination races with friends they've met in running clubs or charity running programs.
