### Our purpose

We are more than a club, we are a community and we believe that as a community we can inspire our members to live healthier and more socially enriched lives.

### We do that by,

Providing runners of all abilities with a safe environment and the emotional support they need to motivate them to start running, keep running and get better at running.

### We achieve this in a multitude of ways, 

- We run together every Tuesday and Thursday night at 6.30pm (Find out more here… <run with us>)
- We thrive as a social community on facebook and twitter
- We meet at park runs and support each other whether as runners, timekeepers or marshals 
- We travel to races together and wear our club kit with pride as we cheer each other on
- We meet for meals, beers, wine and laughter
- We invade foreign lands such as Madrid, Paris and Berlin tackling races as a team and with our families
- We also meet in smaller groups several times a week to run on a slightly more adhoc basis

### Our history

No one knows quite when we began but it was definitely a long long time ago, probably at a bar and it is almost certain that no one expected the club to become the successful 80+ strong community of runners that it is today.

Before the days of ‘Facebook’ and ‘What’s app’ we communicated mainly via carrier pigeon and in those days we were quite small. As our facebook group has become more popular, so has our club and today we exist as much online as we do on the pavements and gravel tracks of Sale and surrounding neighborhoods. 

Over the years faces have changed, some have gone, some have arrived but no matter what, The spirit of the fledglings lives on!!
