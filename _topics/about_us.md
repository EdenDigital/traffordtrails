### Welcome

From beginners to (a bit more) serious runners, Dragons Running club meets every Tuesday and Thursday at 6:30 pm at LA Fitness Brooklands (in the bar)

Come and join us! If you're just starting out as a runner, don't worry, no-one gets left behind on our sessions, as one of our more experienced runners will always run at the pace of the slowest runner on the day. Equally, we will always have a faster front section to train with, all the way up to marathon distance. We have over 50 members and are affiliated to England Athletics.

### Training

Tuesday sessions are 5k and Thursday sessions a bit longer, from 10k up to around 10 miles.We also meet for extra training runs and/or races most weekends.

### Socialising

It's not just about the running either, as the social section of our club organises nights out and weekends away, including running holidays abroad - probably more frequent than our races.
